Wiring and Assembly
===================

Soldering
---------
All of drone wiring is going to require some soldering skill, which you can develop through this project.

If you ae inexperienced with soldering, I would recommend watching this `video from oneTesla <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI>`. After watching that practicing on some practice boards would be strongly advised, you don't want to mess up your expensive flight controller.

To get more specific drone soldering tips you can look to this `video from The Drone Racing League <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct-kvrCdGOY>` which is quite quick and helpful or consider this longer but still information packed `video from TRONCAT FPV <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2funvs3nU7U>`.

Assembly order
--------------
After honing your soldering skills it is important to be conscious of order in which you solder and assemble your drone. I have created this list below as a recommendation for the in which you should make your drone. This is based off of difficulty and of course necessary assembly order to try and give you the opportunity to fine tune your soldering in the easier steps and move up to bigger challenges. 

1. Camera to Flight Controller
2. Video Transmitter to Flight Controller
3. Radio Transmitter to Flight Controller
4. Assemble Bottom half of frame
5. Battery Pigtail to ESC Board
6. Motors and ESC Wiring
7. Flight Controller Mounting
8. Assemble Remainder of Drone
9. Wire Management

Below I have included some tips and tricks for each step along the way.
