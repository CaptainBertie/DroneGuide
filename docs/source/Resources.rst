Resources
=========

If you are ever stuck consulting these resources should be **extremely** helpful. Problem solving is the biggest constant in engineering. It is a transferable skill that will come in handy in all aspects of life, so please don't give up but rather persevere and solve the problem. I promise it will be infinitely more satisfying than quitting.
