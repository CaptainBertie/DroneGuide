Introduction
============

Drones are an amazing product of modern technology. Merely ten years ago, these types of drones were a niche completely outside the view of most tinkerers. Now, they are a widely available and well-known consumer product. You can buy a drone out of the box and have it flying in five minutes. However, a section of unmanned aviators still set out to build their own drones. Commonly referred to as FPV drones, these are typically custom-made by adventurous makers looking to take to the skies. Building an FPV drone is a great way to learn engineering skills, as it touches many different engineering species. Any FPV build requires some electrical engineering to connect all components together. Materials engineering is used in the carbon fiber frames used for these drones. You can even write custom software for your drone; the best part about all this is that it is fun. So, if you are interested in building a drone and expanding your love for STEM, use this guide to help *Make to the Skies*.
