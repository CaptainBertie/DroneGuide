Drone Frame
===========

Prop Size
---------
Your prop size is your first decision when building your drone. It determines the overall size of your drone. Prop sizes typically range from three inches to six inches. A larger six-inch drone will have a more extended battery range and more top speed but will be harder to fly; an added benefit of the size is that you have more room to work with when doing your wiring, which can be helpful for those who are inexperienced with technical stuff like that. Smaller three-inch drones will have less battery range but will be easier to fly, and there are many suitable kits at reasonable prices for three-inch drones.
