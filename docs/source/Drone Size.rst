Drone Size
==========

The size of youre drone is determined by multiple factors:

Propellers
----------


Your prop size is your first decision when building your drone. It determines the overall size of your drone. Prop sizes typically range from three inches to six inches. A larger six-inch drone will have a more extended battery range and more top speed but will be harder to fly; an added benefit of the size is that you have more room to work with when doing your wiring, which can be helpful for those who are inexperienced with technical stuff like that. Smaller three-inch drones will have less battery range but will be easier to fly, and there are many suitable kits at reasonable prices for three-inch drones. 

Batteries
---------
Another important part of drone sizing is the battery. Standard drone batteries are Lithium Polymer Batteries or LiPos. They come in sizes typically ranging from 1s to 6s. This refers to the number of cells in the battery. A 6s battery is six times bigger than a 1s battery and packs much more power. If you are building a bigger drone, you will need a bigger battery. A bigger battery also means more power and speed, so for beginners flying a 6s drone can be quite a challenge. I know myself; I built a 6s drone for my first drone, and it was quite a handful to control. 

Frame
-----
The Drone Frame is mechanical base for everything that happens with a drone. It is important to be conscious of the sizing of your frame when buying other components. I would recommend to initially get an idea of the size dron you wish to build, and from there specify your electronics. Then you should be able to find a frame that fits. The frame has three key measurements; prop size, camera size, flight controller size.
