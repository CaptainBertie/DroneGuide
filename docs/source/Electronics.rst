The drone flight controller is the brain of your drone. It processes all signals onboard the drone and uses it to compute the output for the motors and the signal to send to your headset so that you can get video to your goggles. When selecting a flight controller, it is important to check that it will fit in your frame. They come in standard mounting sizes, typically 30mm by 30mm however it is crucial to check that it matches with your frame. Most modern FPV drones use a flight controller and electronic speed controller stack. This integrates the motor controllers into a single board that fits neatly below your flight controller. This hosts many advantages, firstly it makes wiring a lot easier, secondly you have a major electronic system protected and contained within your frame apposed to how ESC’s are normally mounted, and lastly it typically is a lot more economical to purchase a stack of FC and an ESC board than a FC and then four separate ESCs. Your flight controller is the most key part of your drone and determines what other hardware you can use. **Investing in a solid flight controller is a good first step when building a drone.** One final point to make is that Betaflight is the most well documented and widley used configurator for drones, so buying a flight controller that is compatible with Betaflight is a must in my opinion. Most flight controllers are so dont stress it.
